In a medium pot, melt the butter, brown sugar, and honey over low heat.

In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar, salt, flour, and baking powder and mix well with a whisk. Add the eggs one by one.

Whisk in the butter mixture. Whisk in the lemon and orange zests.

Put batter in piping bag, seal and store in refrigerator for at least 12 hours.

### Day 2: Pipe, Bake, and Serve
Preheat the oven to 350°F and use convection.

Cut an opening about ½ inch straight across the tip of the bag.

Using a bit of cold butter, coat the cavities of the mini madeleine pan. Pipe the madeleine batter into the cavities so that it fills each about three-quarters of the way to the top.

Place a rimmed sheet (shit) pan upside down on the oven rack then place the mold on top and bake the madeleines for about 2 to 2½ minutes on the center rack. When you see the batter puff up in the center, rotate the mold 180 degrees. Bake for 2 to 2½ minutes more, until the sides of the madeleines are golden blonde and the center has set.

Unmold immediately. Using a small sieve, sprinkle confectioners’ sugar evenly over the fresh-baked madeleines. Eat immediately (do not wait for more than even a few minutes!).
