1,Kenji Kung Pao Chicken,"# For the Chicken

5. Add sauce ingredients and stir-fry until all the ingredients are coated evenly and the chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute, adding chicken stock/water 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary to keep the sauce from clumping. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.
