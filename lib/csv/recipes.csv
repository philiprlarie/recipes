1,Kenji Kung Pao Chicken,"# For the Chicken
Combine chicken, 1 tsp. wine, 2 tsp. soy sauce, 2 tsp. cornstarch, and salt in a small bowl and turn until well mixed and chicken is evenly coated in a thin film of the cornstarch paste. Set aside.

# For the Sauce
Combine honey, vinegar, 1 tbsp. wine, 2 tsp. soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp. cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir together with a fork until no clumps of cornstarch remain.

# For the Stir-Fry

Add remaining oil and immediately add chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry until fragrant but not burnt, about 5 seconds.

5. Add sauce ingredients and stir-fry until all the ingredients are coated evenly and the chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute, adding chicken stock/water 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary to keep the sauce from clumping. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.
