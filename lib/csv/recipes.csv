1,Kenji Kung Pao Chicken,"# For the Chicken
Combine chicken, 1 tsp. wine, 2 tsp. soy sauce, 2 tsp. cornstarch, and salt in a small bowl and turn until well mixed and chicken is evenly coated in a thin film of the cornstarch paste. Set aside.

# For the Sauce
Combine honey, vinegar, 1 tbsp. wine, 2 tsp. soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp. cornstarch in a small bowl. Stir together with a fork until no clumps of cornstarch remain.

# For the Stir-Fry
1. Pour a small amount of oil into the bottom of a large wok or skillet and rub around with a paper towel. Place over high heat and preheat until smoking. Add remaining oil and immediately add chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry until fragrant but not burnt, about 5 seconds. Immediately add chicken and stir-fry until there are no longer pink spots on the exterior (chicken will still be raw in center at this stage), 45 seconds to 1 1/2 minutes.

4. Add garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add scallions and peanuts and stir-fry for 30 seconds.

5. Add sauce ingredients and stir-fry until all the ingredients are coated evenly and the chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute, adding chicken stock/water 1 tablespoon at a time if necessary to keep the sauce from clumping. Serve immediately with steamed white rice.

8,Gnocchi,"1. Cook Potatoes: Add potatoes to a pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 20 minutes. Remove from water and let cool on towels to absorb excess moisture

2. Peel and Grate Potatoes: Remove the peels. Grate potatoes finely using a box grater (or, ideally, a potato ricer)

3. Mix Dough: Mound potatoes on a clean work surface. Add flour, then ricotta, then egg, then salt. Whisk with a fork, starting in the center and working your way out. It will get crumbly

4. Knead Dough: Use your hands to gently bring the mixture together into a smooth dough. Don’t overmix it and don’t overflour it!

5. Gnocchify: Form into a loaf. Cut the loaf into slices. Roll each slice into a rope. Cut rope into small pieces

6. Boil: Dust the small pieces with flour to prevent sticking. Working in batches, add the gnocchi to a pot of boiling water. When they rise to the top, remove with a slotted spoon. I usually put em in a bowl and toss with a little olive oil to prevent sticking

7. Serve: Serve with sauce!
